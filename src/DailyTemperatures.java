/***
 * <h1>Daily Temperatures</h1>
 * You are given an array of Integers temperatures where temperatures[i] represents the daily temperatures on the ith day.
 * <p>
 * Return an array result where result[i] is the number of days after the ith day before a warmer temperature appears on a future day. If there is no day in the future where a warmer temperature will appear for the ith day, set result[i] to 0 instead.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: temperatures = [30,38,30,36,35,40,28]
 * <p>
 * Output: [1,4,1,2,1,0,0]
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: temperatures = [22,21,20]
 * <p>
 * Output: [0,0,0]
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * 1 <= temperatures.Length <= 1000.
 * <p>
 * 1 <= temperatures[i] <= 100
